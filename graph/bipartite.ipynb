    "785. Is Graph Bipartite?\n",
    "Medium\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:\n",
    "There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).\n",
    "There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).\n",
    "If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).\n",
    "The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.\n",
    "A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.\n",
    "Return true if and only if it is bipartite.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]\n",
    "Output: false\n",
    "Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]\n",
    "Output: true\n",
    "Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Constraints:\n",
    "graph.length == n\n",
    "1 <= n <= 100\n",
    "0 <= graph[u].length < n\n",
    "0 <= graph[u][i] <= n - 1\n",
    "graph[u] does not contain u.\n",
    "All the values of graph[u] are unique.\n",
    "If graph[u] contains v, then graph[v] contains u."
